# Local Experience Marketplace

## Overview

LME (Local Experience Marketplace) is a project aimed at **job creation** and **tourism** in Rwanda. The mission is to provide tourists with authentic experiences of the country by connecting them with **local guides** who can offer deeper insights into Rwandan culture, history, and natural beauty. The project aims to create **employment opportunities for locals** while promoting **sustainable tourism** through **local-led tours**. 

## Vision & Mission

### Vision
To transform Rwanda's tourism sector by empowering locals to be the **guides** of their own culture, providing tourists with meaningful connections, and supporting the growth of local economies.

### Mission
- **Job Creation**: Provide employment to local Rwandans who can work as tour guides for tourists.
- **Cultural Exchange**: Allow tourists to explore Rwanda through the eyes of its citizens, gaining a deeper understanding of its culture, traditions, and landscapes.
- **Sustainability**: Promote **green tourism** by encouraging responsible, community-driven tourism that benefits both visitors and locals.

## Problem

- Many tourism experiences in Rwanda are centered around traditional tourist spots and often fail to provide **authentic interactions** with local people.
- **Unemployment** is an issue, particularly in rural areas where tourism could be a viable source of income.
- Existing tour guides often lack opportunities to expand their services beyond mainstream tourist routes.

## Solution

LME aims to bridge the gap by offering tourists **personalized tours led by locals**. Local guides, including community members and existing tour guides, will share their knowledge of Rwanda's **hidden gems**, culture, history, and natural landscapes. This approach will:
- Allow tourists to connect with **local people** in meaningful ways.
- Create **new job opportunities** for individuals in the tourism sector.
- **Diversify tourism** by focusing on **sustainable** and **culturally rich** experiences.

- **Local Guides**: Rwandans who are passionate about sharing their culture and history, as well as trained tour guides.
- **Local Communities**: Individuals and groups that will benefit economically from this tourism model.
